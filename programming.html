        <h2>Programming Languages Used</h2>
        <p>This page includes a list of different programming languages I've used previously and recently.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="left" id="lua">
        <h3>Lua</h3>
        <p>Lua was the first programming language I was introduced to when I was in middle school. While I didn't know much about how to use it, I would generally look at other people's code and mess with the numbers to see what would change.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left" id="javascript">
        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript was the first programming language I attempted to learn. I watched tutorials on Khan Academy in high school to teach me how to code. While I didn't get very far initially, it did teach me some of the most basic concepts such as while loops and if statements. It wasn't until a couple weeks ago that I began using it again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="left" id="r">
        <h3>R</h3>
        <p>R was the first programming language that I truly learned. I learned most of how to use R in college but also learned a lot in my own projects. It's mainly used for statistical purposes so I wasn't taught many of the in-depth concepts such as classes. Regardless it served as a great stepping stone for me getting into programming!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="right" id="cpp">
        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p>C++ is where I learned the basics of how to properly use functions and classes. While I only spent about six months learning C++, I most likely learned the most about programming in this time.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="left" id="java">
        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java was my most recent addition to the programming languages I learned. While I already knew the majority of the basics, using this language helped me understand the various similarities between other programming languages especially C++ since they're both OOP languages.</p>
